# Data-Analysis-Case
I was asked to complete a Data Analysis task (you can check the task in the pptx file). So, I decided to approach the task in three different ways. The first way is by using the "matplotlib_task.ipynb" file, where you can find only the functions, and the actual analysis is in the "matplotlib_task.py" file. In this file, you can find all the analyses done using the Matplotlib library. The second approach is through the "plotly_task.ipynb" file, which contains only the functions, while the main analysis is in the "plotly_task.py" file. Here, you will find clusters created using the K-Means method and an MLPRegressor Model.


Here is a screeshot of the matplotlib version:

And here is the plotly version:

Finally, in this repository you can also find a dashboard created with Dash/Plotly with all the analysis made before. To run the dashboard you must have all the files from the assets folder and just run the "app_v12.ipynb".


The app should open like this:

Don't forget to get the "decision_science_dataset.csv" data in order to run all the files in this repository.
